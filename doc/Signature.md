# Sprint Signature



| Date        | Time Spent | Events
|-------------|------------|--------------------
| January  20 |  2.5 hours | Reviewed project requirements, tested the source code, reviewed how to properly document changes, reviewed both developer team's Software Development Plans (Problem likely in how the game board is set up, with one team using 1D and the other team using 2D for the board list)
| January  21 |  1.5 hours | Worked on Plan.md (Phase 0), tested source code and found the easter egg as well as how to access it (input 'joshua' when selecting a game mode, found there are two 'def open_cells' and two 'def first_open_cell' with one from each development team, 
| January  23 |  1.0 hours | Read the documentation on creating modules for programs and worked on which functions and lines should be in which module, created model.py module and cut the MODEL array into it with a import statement for it in ttt.py
| January  25 |  1.5 hours | Updated section 1 of Plan.md in which I designed modules to create, implemented those modules and created import statements in ttt.py, did a preliminary test and found they didn't work so I put import statements connecting all of the modules to each other and found it still didn't work. I will work on fixing that tomorrow, I've got a class right now.
| January  26 |  4.5 hours | Worked on debugging my code and getting the modules to work together, and changed the boardAiTeam and boardUiTeam to be one module and just interchange the differing code to test. I couldn't figure out was going wrong then got some help at the cs coaching center and realized that I hadn't fixed the two and one dimensional boards problems, so I changed the open-cells function and the strategy-oracle functions to use one-dimensional lists more effectively.
